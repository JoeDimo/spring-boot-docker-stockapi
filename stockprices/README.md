## Trendiest Stock Finder

---
This simple app calls the Yahoo Finance API for the 20 highest trending stocks at 
any given moment, selects number one from that list, and prints its information to
the command line. The app is an example of Java Spring Boot application 
development with API calls, JSON to POJO conversions, and containerization with 
Docker.
